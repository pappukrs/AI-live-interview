# AI Mock Interview Platform

## Overview

AI Mock Interview Platform is an intelligent interview simulation system that conducts real-time mock interviews using AI. The platform analyzes a candidate’s resume, generates personalized interview questions based on experience, evaluates spoken or written answers, and provides structured feedback.

The system supports a **Bring Your Own API Key (BYOK)** model where users can use their own AI provider API keys (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude), allowing scalable and cost-efficient usage.

This project aims to simulate a real interviewer experience using:

* Resume-based question generation
* Voice or text answers
* AI-driven evaluation
* Performance feedback
* Interview analytics

---

##  Problem Statement

Candidates struggle to prepare for real interviews because:

* No personalized mock interview tools exist
* Generic question lists are ineffective
* Lack of feedback on communication and correctness
* No real-time interview simulation

This platform solves these problems using AI.
